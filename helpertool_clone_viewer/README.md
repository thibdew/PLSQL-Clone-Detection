# Clone Viewer
Generates an interactive HTML-file to view the clones in an easy manner. 

## Installation
```sh
$ cd helpertool_clone_viewer
$ javac *.java
$ jar -cfm CloneViewer.jar Manifest.txt .
```
This generates an JAR-file which you can use to generate the HTML-file.

## Usage
```sh
$ cd Folder/containing/JAR/file
$ java -jar CloneViewer.jar [CloneFile.xml] [/Path/To/queries/]
```
`[CloneFile.xml]` is the location of a XML-file with clones generated by one of the two tools. `[/Path/To/queries/]` is the path to the folder containing the SQL-files (with a PL/SQL-query).  Make sure to include the trailing `/`.
This outputs an `output.html` file with which you can easely view and compare all instances of a Clone.

Selecting a clone can be done by clicking in the corresponding row in the table. The order of the table can be altered by clicking on a table-header. After clicking on a clone, all instances of the clone appear in the left box. The first number indicates the starting line-number of the clone in the instance, it is followed by the name of the query.
Viewing an instance can be done by clicking on it. The clone is then displayed on the right. 
By selecting two instances, you can compare them. The right preview will highlight every difference between the two instances.
